I decided to use a class to store all of the lab results. To run the method you must:
1. Instantiate a new instance of the class.
2. Run the updateStorage method in the class with the path to the json file.
3. Run the findLastThree method with the result_id of the test that you wish to find the previous three of.

To run the tests with Mocha and Chai you must:
1. Run npm install in terminal.
2. Run npm test.
